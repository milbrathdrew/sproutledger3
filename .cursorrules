# .cursorrules for SproutLedger

1. Always refer to the current DEV_PLAN.md for all development decisions and feature work. Update DEV_PLAN.md as necessary when requirements change or new features are proposed.
2. If any proposed item or code change strays from the current development plan, it must be clearly highlighted in communication and explicitly approved before implementation.
3. Follow a strict branching system:
   - All new features must be developed in `feature/<feature-name>` branches.
   - All bugfixes must be developed in `bugfix/<description>` branches.
   - Use `main` for stable releases and `develop` for ongoing integration.
   - All changes must be merged via pull request and reviewed.
4. Focus exclusively on MVP features and tasks until the boolean `MVP_COMPLETE` in DEV_PLAN.md is set to YES. No post-MVP work may begin until this is changed and approved.
5. DEV_PLAN.md must include the branch names for all completed and in-progress work, clearly indicating which branch corresponds to each feature or fix.
